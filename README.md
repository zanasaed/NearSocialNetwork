In this repository, I have placed the required files for use in the gephi program


* Use the edgesData.csv file to use the raw data. First, download the file, then enter the file in the gephi   to create a network graph.


* If you want to see the final result, use the ge.gephi file.
* Use the rootnear.ge file to view the network graph around the rootnearge.gephi.
